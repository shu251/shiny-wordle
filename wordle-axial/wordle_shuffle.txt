WORDS	DES	URL
vents	Hydrothermal vents in the deep-sea are sites where seawater enters the Earth's crust, interacts with hot rocks, and then reemerges as chemically-modified hot water.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFAu8CqCtR8
graze	A major goal of our work at Axial Seamount is to obtain rates of grazing, specifically where heterotrophic microbial eukaryotes graze, or consume, the vent-associated bacteria and archaea coming out of the seafloor at diffuse flow hydrothermal vents.	https://shu251.github.io/sarah-hu/images/GR-comic-protistsession-updated.png
depth	The depth of active venting at Axial Seamount is right around 1500 meters (4900 feet)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nwg2T8i_48&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=9
magma	Magma is the molten or partially molten rock located in Earthâ€™s crust and serves as the 'feeder' system for lava to the seafloor. Basically, eruptions occur after magma accumulates in the magma chamber and is ejected or extruded onto the seafloor once the pressure of magma and gasses accumulate and cannot contain the overlying rock. Using some very cool seismic imaging tools, the magma chamber beneath Axial Seamount has even been visualized! 	https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/science/axial-volcano-mapping.html
cable	Axial Seamount is home to the NSF supported Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI) Regional Cabled Array (RCA), so there is continuous power supplied to instruments at the volcano	https://oceanobservatories.org/regional-cabled-array/
rates	We are interested in how fast microbes grow and die in venting fluids at Axial Seamount. For example, at what rate (cells per hour) do protists consume bacteria? Or, at what rate (carbon per minute) to cells fix CO2?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JeH6TTwBtU&list=PLoPslT-m1sgQ1vz4Jga9Ix04YJKtGoAt3&index=21
ships	We cannot do our work without amazing research ships like the R/V Thompson. At 274 feet, she is our home away from home and provides everything the team needs, from excellent science support to delicious dinners to cozy cabins.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtDiSeaXvQU&list=PLRk9nnqFxr2_r6bbfCVBvmsWtUI279XwN&index=4
mixes	Deep seawater enters into the crust, gets chemically modified at high temperature, and then returns to the seafloor. During this circulation path, it mixes with seawater, especially on its way out. The difference between the black smokers we see at Axial and the diffuse vents is that the smokers don't mix until they exit the seafloor, whereas the diffuse fluids have already mixed with seawater in the crust.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFAu8CqCtR8
casts	We will collect seawater from the plume and background environment by 'CTD cast'. CTD stands for conductivity, temperature, and depth, and refers to a package of electronic instruments that measure these properties, connected to water bottles to collect samples.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N2UsPDczTw
niche	In biology, we use the word niche to describe the specific environment an organism lives in, such as its temperature or physical surroundings, as well as the role the organism plays in the community. For example, at Axial, there are microbes that can fix inorganic carbon into carbon using chemical energy from the vent fluids- these organisms are called autotrophs and their niche ranges from cool to very warm niches within the vent ecosystem.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83B3njrUDq4&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=6
axial	Axial Seamount is an active submarine volcano about 300 miles off the coast of Oregon. First discovered in 198X, it is the best studied underwater volcano in the world and last erupted in 2015.	https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/eoi/axial_site.html
media	To study microorganisms in our laboratory, we try to isolate them from their natural habitat and transfer them to 'growth media' that ideally contains all the nutrients and resources they need to survive. We spend lots of time making different media types that will target certain microbial species. At Axial Seamount, several of us have brought various media to try to isolate specific autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYDnxbk6XxM&list=PLoPslT-m1sgSAut0HfovdqVhpDqMI7MmL&index=9
crabs	While working at Axial Seamount, you might see Spider Crabs, a major predators and scavenger. They hang out on lava flow and eat vent animals such as tube worms and limpets. 	https://novae.ocean.washington.edu/story/Crustaceans_at_Axial#:~:text=Spider%20Crabs%20are%20major%20predators,the%20seafloor%20to%20their%20mouths.
worms	When we visit the hydrothermal vents at Axial, one of the animals we will see are tubeworms. Tubeworms, like Ridgeia piscesae, form clusters near venting fluid with high sulfide concentrations and are at higher temperatures. Tubeworms thrive through a symbiotic relationship with chemoautotrophic bacteria.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK5dXMHSIu8
micro	Our main research themes at in the #protatax cruise all involve microorganisms! Mainly the bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes running the vent associated food web.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83B3njrUDq4&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=6
cycle	Microbes play an important role in biogeochemical cycling of elemnts on Earth and especially in the ocean. We are interesting in quantifying their role in these cycles, especially the carbon cycle.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83B3njrUDq4&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=6
watch	When we're at sea with ROV Jason, everyone participates in a 'watch'. This allows us to perform operations 24 hours a day. When you're on watch, you report to the ROV Jason control van (mission control!) and work with the whole team by collecting data, recording timestamps of significant events, and more!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=271qeRHjVaA
crust	Oceanic crust, consisting of rock, makes up the seafloor and is continuously being created by plate tectonics at mid-ocean ridges like the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where Axial Seamount is located. Axial Seamount consists of basaltic rock, with lots of pillow lavas.	https://kids.kiddle.co/Oceanic_crust
fluid	We often use the term 'hydrothermal vent fluid' to describe the water we are collecting from Axial Seamount hydrothermal vent fluids. That is because this fluid isn't exactly seawater- instead, it has been modified by traveling through the crust and reacting at high temperatures, changing its chemistry. When it comes back out in a vent, we call it a vent fluid.	https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/eoi/axial_site.html
hosts	One strategy that deep-sea organisms use is symbiosis. The 'host' microbe or animal will be closely associated with a symbiotic microorganism. In many cases, the host and symbiont exchange beneficial nutrients and resources.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DENg6lOr0M&list=PLxfJEARDJfRzdaV93HPb0FXErO5lzN9Na&index=3
oasis	Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are often referred to as a 'biological oasis'! The chemosynthetic-derived energy at the site of active venting supports a local hub of diverse life. 	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtV-FP212Uc
plume	Plumes are created when hydrothermal vent fluid is injected into the ocean at hydrothermal vent fields like Axial Seamount. At Axial, these plumes are black from iron-sulfide mineral particles that precipitate as the hot hydrothermal fluids mix with cold seawater. We use the CTD Niskin system to detect temperature and particle anomalies and collect these plumes.	https://www.whoi.edu/feature/history-hydrothermal-vents/explore/plumes.html
cilia	Cilia look like hair around a cell, but they enable microorganisms to move through the water or create a current to bring in food.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyQfvxH425Q
slurp	The ROV Jason has a suction sampler, also referred to as the slurp sampler. It is basically a deep-sea vacuum cleaner and we use it to slurp up small animals, microbial mats, and sediments.	https://deepwatercanyons.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/picking-slurping-and-plunging/
omics	Many of the samples collected at Axial Seamount will be sequenced for 'metagenomics' and 'metatranscriptomics', nicknamed 'omics'. After extracting the genetic material from the fluid sampled (DNA and RNA) we sequence this for meta'omic analyses. These sequences represent all the microbial life in those samples.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQLSAbxY8NI&list=PLxfJEARDJfRzSKnW3co7JvWc-1SO0Ec87&index=42
tubes	When we visit the hydrothermal vents at Axial, one of the animals we will see are tubeworms. Tubeworms, like Ridgeia piscesae, form clusters near venting fluid with high sulfide concentrations and are at higher temperatures. Tubeworms thrive through a symbiotic relationship with chemoautotrophic bacteria.,	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W_ywzhkR90
phile	The term 'phile' means fondness for a specified thing. For microbes, we use it describe microbes that live at high temperature (thermophile) or low pH (acidophile) and many others. Collectively, organims that live at extremes where people like us can't live are referred to as 'extremophiles'. 	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FOagjNpQ&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=26
winch	By expertly hauling and handling the ropes and wires to deploy our instruments, the winch is a key part of the research vessel's operations!	https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/vessels/thompson/thompson.html
cells	Cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. The human body is composed of trillions of cells. At Axial, we are studying microbial cells, including bacteria, archaea, and protists. Most of these are two small to be seen with the naked eye, so we use microscopes and other concentrating mechanisms to study them.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9I5MpocxA&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=4
ocean	The ocean covers 71% of Earth's surface and is basically a giant body of saltwater. Although Earth has one global ocean, it is traditionally divided into the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic and Southern oceans. Our work at Axial is in the northeast Pacific ocean.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV3OtxB9BKE&list=PL1CGd4Scv4GIcuIhR6JCSc4lQ4c9u2mzN
tools	We use lots of tools during our expedition to build many of the devices we use to sample vent fluid. We have a lot of tool boxes... especially, when we are working with Jason!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk_MaS5UU44&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=11
fixed	If we want to collect a sample and preserve the macro- and micro-organisms, we add a stabilizing chemical that 'fixes' the samples. Then we can visualize these fixed samples at the microscope back on land.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83B3njrUDq4&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=6
troph	Autotroph, chemotroph, chemoautotroph, mixotroph, phagotroph, or heterotroph! There are many ways to describe the mode in which microorganisms obtain their energy and nutrients.  	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83B3njrUDq4&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=6
fauna	Fauna are the animals of a particular region, habitat, or geological period. At Axial Seamount, there are very unique vent fauna, including tubeworms, limpets, crabs, and more.	https://novae.ocean.washington.edu/story/Biology_at_Axial_Seamount
robot	On this cruise, one of our favorite robots is ROV Jason! Remotely operating this vehicle from the ship means we can observe and study the seafloor longer. Another popular robot onboard is the espresso machine.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=271qeRHjVaA
genes	Genes contain the DNA information needed to specify physical and biological traits. Most genes code for specific proteins which have differing functions. While humans have approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes, microbes have many many more, simply do to the fact that there are so many microbes on the Earth. We are interested in studying microbial genes at Axial to understand how microbes get energy, who they are related to, how they cope in the vent environment, and more!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUbi3bgRivs&list=PLxfJEARDJfRztdwC9gMCCVT1NaBubyFkw&index=18
astro	The work we are doing at Axial Seamount is relevant to the field of astrobiology, which is broadly the study of life in the universe. Some astrobiologists believe that hydrothermal vents in Earthâ€™s early oceans could have been important in the origins and evolution of life on our planet, and we are also interested in whether or not life might even exist  beyond Earth, such as on Ocean Worlds of Enceladus and Europa!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkozZMEKJwk
rocks	Like much of the seafloor, Axial is made up of basaltic rocks. Basalt comprises more than 90% of all volcanic rocks, and almost all of the black shiny stuff you see on the seafloor is basalt!	https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/underwater-volcano-eruption-prediction-axial-seamount-science
jason	Jason is the name of the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) we are using to do our science at Axial Seamount. It is connected to the ship via a cable and can stay down for days at a time, collecting samples, deploying instruments, and basically being our hands and eyes on the seafloor!	https://tinyurl.com/rovjason
water	Water water everywhere! Whether from venting fluids or the deep ocean, this is definitely a cruise all about the water! Despite being called Earth, we definitely live on a water world	https://astronomy.com/magazine/2019/04/where-did-earths-water-come-from
dives	To explore a hydrothermal vent, ROV Jason dives to the seafloor, but remains tethered to the ship. Each time the vehicle goes into the water, we call it a Jason dive and give it a number. So far, Jason has done over 1400 dives since beginning operations in 2002!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObnP3pyh-rk&list=PLRk9nnqFxr2_r6bbfCVBvmsWtUI279XwN&index=6
meter	In science, we use the metric system, so all of our depths, sizes and distances are reported in kilometers or meters or micrometers! Every meter is about 3.3 ft and Axial sits at 1520m.	https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/eoi/axial_site.html
virus	Viruses cannot make copies of themselves without having a host, such as a microbe, a crab, or a human! They are tiny infectious agents that contain either DNA or RNA. While we know a lot about viruses and human health (e..g COVID!), we know much less about them in the ocean, where they are an important part of the microbial loop, meaning through killing microbes, they release carbon into the ecosystem. At Axial, we will be studying both RNA and DNA viruses in the hydrothermal vent fluids, plumes, and even vent animals.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6aaWH2Qbt8&list=PLxfJEARDJfRzSKnW3co7JvWc-1SO0Ec87&index=48
